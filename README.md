# InventorySystem
In particular, this Inventory Management System project in C# MySQL focuses mainly on keeping track of inventory activities.
To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of inventories with respect to their sales. Also, the system displays all the paid, unpaid transactions of the items.
In addition, the system allows managing system users and more. Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with a manager and customer panel.
In an overview of this web application, an admin has full control over the system. He/she can manage employees, inventory items, and sales. 
Here, an admin can perform almost every work but still, the main role is to oversee the flow of the system.
